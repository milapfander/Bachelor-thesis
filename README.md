This Repository includes the Code and Figures to my Bachelor thesis on "Non-parametric density estimation with the Gaussian copula kernel".

Under "Figures", all Figures displayed in the thesis are uploaded.

The folder "Code" inludes 5 files. "Copula theory.R" contains the code used to plot data simulated from selected copulas and "kde theory.R" contains the code used to plot illustrative graphics on kernel density estimation.

"One-dimensional.R" contains an implementation of the Jones-Henerson estimator (Jones and Henderson 2007), as well as the Code to some illustrative figures.

"Two-dimensional.R" respectively includes an implementation of a two-dimensional extension of the Jones-Henerson estimator through product kernels. Code to the respective Figures is included as well.

"More-dimensional.R" contains an implementation of a multivariate extension of the Jones-Henderson estimator through product kernels.
